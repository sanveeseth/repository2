<td> Space, Space, full of heavenly bodies, <br>
Some known some yet to explore. <br>
The smell of dying stars and gases,<br>
Is its distinct spoor.<br>
<br>
Sun, Asteroid, Planets and Stars,<br>
With my naked eyes, I want to see Mars.<br>
O’ beautiful stars which give sky its shine,<br>
Form constellations so divine!<br>
<br>
The sun , the big bright ball,<br>
Like a burning hall,<br>
Gives the Moon, its brightness,<br>
Without it the Earth would be lifeless.<br>
<br>
The planets are a huge part of Solar System,<br>
Orbiting the Sun is their lifelong mission.<br>
Asteroid visible to scientist at night,<br>
Make up an asteroid belt when they unite.<br>
<br>
Meteoroids the one meter, rocky and metallic bodies in space ,<br>
Also known as shooting star, superstition say, they decide our fate.<br>
<br>
 The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite,<br>
Neither have gravity nor a field of magnetite.<br>
<br>
The surface of the Moon is rocky and uneven<br>
The planets with most moons is Saturn.<br>
<br>
Mercury is the smallest, second hottest and densest one,<br>
Has a molten core and is closest to the sun.<br>
<br>
Venus unlike others, spins clockwise on axis, <br>
The day there, is longer than a year,<br>
Has 90 times atmospheric pressure of the earth,<br>
It is the hottest planet and could burn your ear.<br>
<br>
Our mother earth, the only planet that supports life,<br>
Has beautiful oceans, rivers and forests in rife.<br>
<br>
Scientists are trying to find life on Mars<br>
The red planet is named after Roman GOD of war.<br>
<br>
Jupiter, the largest planet of all,<br>
With 76 moons, is the fastest spinner of them all.<br>
A great red spot has been surrounded for a long time,<br>
Its magnetic field is just sublime.<br>
<br>
Saturn, the beautiful planet with rings,<br>
Mostly made of gases, can float on water like it has wings.<br>
<br>
Unlike other planet it rotates on the side<br>
Yes, it is Uranus with rings made of ice.<br>
<br>
Neptune the farthest planet of Solar System,<br>
Has 17 times mass of Earth and is little bigger than Uranus.<br>
<br>
My dream is to be an astronaut,<br>
Like Valentina cosmonaut.<br>
The space is such a unique sight,<br>
I observe it every night.

<td> Covid-19 is on every news station, <br>
Ruining lives across the nation.<br>
<br>
Over the world it spreads,<br>
Because of which doctors can’t rest their heads.<br>
<br>
This quarantine is so boring,<br>
Inner creativity we all are exploring.<br>
<br>
Can’t go to park to play,<br>
Have to be at home whole day.<br>
<br>
Oh! How much I miss my school, teachers and friends,<br>
I pray to god that covid-19 soon comes to an end.<br>
<br>
My dear friends, to prevent this virus easily,<br>
Wash your hands more frequently.<br>
<br>
Keep calm and be creative in this phase,<br>
I request everyone to follow all rules and be safe.<br>
<br>
Children don’t play outside, play indoors,<br>
As this pandemic has no other cure.<br>
<br>
Work from home don’t go out,<br>
Social distancing should be followed through out.<br>
<br>
A hero comes in many forms, this is very true,<br>
To me, the heroes are the doctors and police, thankyou<br>
